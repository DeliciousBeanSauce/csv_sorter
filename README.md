# csv_sorter

This is a project for work which creates a sorting function for our warehouse packing system that is not implemented by default.
It takes in a product list CSV file with product information, turns it into a dataframe and transforms certain aspects like category linking with custom zones to create a sortable list.

It creates a HTML file since I was most familiar with manipulating it to get desired visual representation of data.
